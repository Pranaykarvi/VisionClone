# VisionClone
## 🚀 Overview
VisionClone is an AI-powered image generation tool that allows users to upload an image and receive AI-generated similar images. It is powered by a custom-trained deep learning model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, offering high accuracy and efficient image transformation. The project includes a web-based GUI where users can interact with the model seamlessly.

## 📌 Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Image Generation** – Uses advanced neural networks for generating similar images.
- **Custom Model Training** – Built from scratch and trained on CIFAR-10.
- **Web-Based Interface** – Easy-to-use GUI for image uploads and results.
- **Deployed Model** – Accessible for real-time predictions.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
VisionClone/
│── model/ # Contains trained deep learning models
│── web_app/ # Web interface files
│── dataset/ # Training dataset and preprocessing scripts

```

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** CIFAR-10 (from Kaggle: `amishfaldu/cifar10dataset`)
- **Format:** TFRecord
- **Preprocessing:** Images resized, normalized, and augmented before training.

## ⚙️ Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** Custom CNN trained on CIFAR-10
- **Layers:** Convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations
- **Training:** Trained using Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss
